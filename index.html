            <h2>Currently,</h2>
            <p>I am in Washington. I am a Microsoft Explorer Intern on the Edge team. 
            I am learning about being a web developer, specifically understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I can create web content including content for creating a PWA functionality.
            Specifically, my team and I will be creating a feature called Change List, which will allow users to know what changes have been made whenever new versions of PWAs are available.</p>
